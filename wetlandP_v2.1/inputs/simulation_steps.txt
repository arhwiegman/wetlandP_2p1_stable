In this chapter I demonstrate the use of the model for estimating event level P dynamics, using a simple set of inputs. 

Environmental Factors:
Temperature = c(2,20) # AKA biology effects
Flooddepth = c(0.5) # keep constant
Floodduration = c(2,20) # 
Residence time = c(0.1,10,20) # affects flow velocity 
ISS = c(5,50) # inorganic suspended sediments 
OSS = c(1,5) # organic suspended sediments
SRP = c(0.005,0.05) # the range of what was observed in the river
ISS2TP_slope = c(0.5e-3,1e-3) # 1e-3 is roughly what I observed at otter creek

Soil Factors:
LOI = c(0.05,0.5) #(affects bulk density and combines with Fines to affect Smax)
Fines = c(0.7,0.9) #(combines with LOI to affect Smax)
PSR = c(0.05,0.5) #(combines with LOI and fines to affect, exchangeable IP pool)
